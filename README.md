# wrp_drugs

This drug script was made for WhiteoutRP, but I am releasing it to the public as I believe it is a pretty unique piece. Almost everything is customizable in the CFG of the script and adding new drugs in is as simple as just copypasting the other drug and changing things up. You can set specific selling coordinates or you can just allow the players to sell anywhere they want, where there are NPC's because you're selling the drugs to them. The script requires a tiny bit of tidying up, but I will do it over time, as I don't have that much free time now!

# Dependancies
  -ESX (required)
  -Mythic notifications(required unless you change the code to suite whatever you need)
  
# Known bugs
  =Sometimes it doesn't sell the drugs, I will investigate it and fix it later this week
  -The global selling setting isn't fixed for multiple drugs, so I will try adding that this week as well
  -As I said, need to tidy up a bit, but the performance at the moment seems clean enough.

# About me
  I am a pretty new coder in the Fivem scene, but I've done some GameDev before, so I believe I have some experience to create some pretty good content. If you like the script here, I am streaming whenever I code, so you can follow me on Twitch @ https://twitch.tv/draven4s to show that you'd like similar content released publically!
